In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 1

Laura, a historical approach to understanding E&M is a really great idea. I've personally been fascinated with the development of physics, what ideas get taken up, and how. This is a great idea for a project. I think that a lot of your literature will either come from AJP or from History of Physics literature. There's a few well known scholars in the field that might be useful looking into: Catherine Westfall, Roger Stuewer, and Allan Franklin. They might be more philosophy of science folks, but looking into this field might help you find important articles. I hope that you will find two articles to summarize by Friday. The one you proposed as the stem for your interest is a good one. Here's a Dropbox link to it: https://www.dropbox.com/s/toa9gudu388ogcv/1.1969140.pdf?dl=0 Great work!

* Score: 20/20
