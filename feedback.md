In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 5

Laura, excellent work this week. I can really see how your paper has come together and I apprecaited the discussion at the top of your paper, which provided context for what you were doing. I think that your narrative makes sense and provides an interesting perspective on what we often take from granted (i.e., a complete description of E&M). For next week, I think you just carry on cleaning up and clarifying your points. Great job!

## Assignment 4

Laura, this is an excellent synthesis of your background; also, it's very interesting to read. I'm wondering how this background will be connected to a larger paper, which is the goal for this week. So I think to the extent that you can write this week on the paper to frame an overall narrative for the piece. I'm curious about how you might take this beyond reporting what you have read to a interesting report on what the story is. I think your writing is hinting at some overarching narrative, but thinking through that this week will be good to set you up to complete the paper. Great work. Here's the link to the paper that you requested: https://www.dropbox.com/s/r8939dq8y570hi5/1.14682.pdf?dl=0

## Assignment 3

Laura, you are doing a great job reading these papers and summarizing them. I do really appreciate how you are starting to form your paper and the way you intend to layout the arguments. You will get to try that on next week in a detailed summary across the papers. So, great work. To anderrs your question about a modern variation, I might suggest that you look into how Maxwell's equations are consistent with special relativity. There's a few thought experiments, moving lines of charge that might be useful there. You can start by reading the last Chapter of Griffith's; there's some references to AJP articles in that chapter that might help you along the way. Great job.

## Assignment 2

Laura, great work this week. It looks like you really dove into these papers and found some very interesting aspects about the development of E&M theory. I think that individually these papers are interesting and bring up more questions for me than answers: For example, how does the velocity component commute with the component of the H field? How does that commutation relationship demostrate a divergence-less field? I think I will need to read some of these, so thank you for that! Interestingly, we will learn a single equation that describes all of Maxwell's equations using a tensor form once we get to relativity. I think that the work you have ahead of you is going to be synthesizing across these papers what you are learning about he development of E&M theory. For next week, it's fine to continue reading additional papers on this, but you will want to start eyeing how you make an argument that they are tied together in some fashion, as the following week will ask you to start working on the outline of the paper.

## Assignment 1

Laura, a historical approach to understanding E&M is a really great idea. I've personally been fascinated with the development of physics, what ideas get taken up, and how. This is a great idea for a project. I think that a lot of your literature will either come from AJP or from History of Physics literature. There's a few well known scholars in the field that might be useful looking into: Catherine Westfall, Roger Stuewer, and Allan Franklin. They might be more philosophy of science folks, but looking into this field might help you find important articles. I hope that you will find two articles to summarize by Friday. The one you proposed as the stem for your interest is a good one. Here's a Dropbox link to it: https://www.dropbox.com/s/toa9gudu388ogcv/1.1969140.pdf?dl=0 Great work!
