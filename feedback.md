# Feedback on Project Work
## Laura Wood

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 3

Laura, you are doing a great job reading these papers and summarizing them. I do really appreciate how you are starting to form your paper and the way you intend to layout the arguments. You will get to try that on next week in a detailed summary across the papers. So, great work. To anderrs your question about a modern variation, I might suggest that you look into how Maxwell's equations are consistent with special relativity. There's a few thought experiments, moving lines of charge that might be useful there. You can start by reading the last Chapter of Griffith's; there's some references to AJP articles in that chapter that might help you along the way. Great job.

## Assignment 2

Laura, great work this week. It looks like you really dove into these papers and found some very interesting aspects about the development of E&M theory. I think that individually these papers are interesting and bring up more questions for me than answers: For example, how does the velocity component commute with the component of the H field? How does that commutation relationship demostrate a divergence-less field? I think I will need to read some of these, so thank you for that! Interestingly, we will learn a single equation that describes all of Maxwell's equations using a tensor form once we get to relativity. I think that the work you have ahead of you is going to be synthesizing across these papers what you are learning about he development of E&M theory. For next week, it's fine to continue reading additional papers on this, but you will want to start eyeing how you make an argument that they are tied together in some fashion, as the following week will ask you to start working on the outline of the paper.

## Assignment 1

Laura, a historical approach to understanding E&M is a really great idea. I've personally been fascinated with the development of physics, what ideas get taken up, and how. This is a great idea for a project. I think that a lot of your literature will either come from AJP or from History of Physics literature. There's a few well known scholars in the field that might be useful looking into: Catherine Westfall, Roger Stuewer, and Allan Franklin. They might be more philosophy of science folks, but looking into this field might help you find important articles. I hope that you will find two articles to summarize by Friday. The one you proposed as the stem for your interest is a good one. Here's a Dropbox link to it: https://www.dropbox.com/s/toa9gudu388ogcv/1.1969140.pdf?dl=0 Great work!
